0,Goal,"The quality of life improves on Waihi without recourse to commercial logging, or destruction of the environment",Before-after changes in perception to commericial logging and its alternatives,Annual surveys of individuals,"Development of cash crop does not undermine biodiversity goals, locals recognise viability of vanilla export is dependent on success of wildlife program"
1,Purpose,Household income is increased ,Income compared to baseline,Survey of households,The price of vanilla makes export viable
1.1,Output ,Vanilla crop is exported,Weight of vanilla exported,Survey of households,Vanilla crop does not fail
1.1.3,Activity,Vanilla planted out,Number of vanilla seedlings planted out,Nursery records,Land disputes do not prevent planting
1.1.2,Activity,Vanilla propagation is undertaken in the nurseries,Number of vanilla seedlings propagated,Nursery records,Community disputes do not result in nurseries being abandoned
1.1.1,Activity,Locals are trained in vanilla production methods,Number of people trained,Training sign-in records,"Access to training is not politicised, women are not excluded"
2,Purpose,Fuel-wood use becomes sustainable,Projected fuel-wood supply exceeds demand,Survey of households,Per capita fuel wood use will not increase in the medium term
2.1,Output,Fuel wood husbandry is socialised,Number of households planning for future fuel wood demand,Survey of households,Community will adopt fuel wood planting as a regular practice
2.1.1,Activity,Fuel wood seedlings are planted out,Number of fuel wood seedlings planted out,Nursery records,Land disputes do not prevent planting
2.1.2,Activity,Fuel wood propagation is undertaken in the nurseries,Number of fuel wood seedlings propagated,Nursery records,Community disputes do not result in nurseries being abandoned
2.1.3,Activity,Nurseries are built,Number of nurseries established,Annual nursery visitations,"Building materials are not stolen during construction, community disputes do not result in nurseries being abandoned"
2.1.4,Activity,Locals are trained in fuel wood propagation,Number of people trained,Training sign-in records,"Access to training is not politicised, women are not excluded"
3,Purpose,Sustainable consumption of farmed fish offsets possible protein reductions from wild sourced meat,Weight of fish consumed offsets and exceeds that of wild sourced meat,Threshold surveys,Hunting will diminish with increased fish production
3.1,Output ,Fish farmers adopt new fish food ,Number of fish farmers adopting new method,Surveys of individuals,Fish farmers will adopt new methods
3.1.1,Activity,Locals are trained to make the best performing fish food,Number of people trained,Training sign-in records,"Access to training is not politicised, women are not excluded"
3.1.2,Activity,Differing fish food formulas are trialed in an in situ experiment,Statistical evidence of effectiveness of fish food,Study data,Fish farmers agreed to participate in study
3.1.3,Activity,Balance of fish versus wildlife protein is assessed,Weight of animal protein consumed,Threshold surveys,Locals are willing to participate survey
4,Purpose,Previously hunted wildlife shows stablity over the short term,Camera trap indices of wildlife populations show either stability or recovery,Camera trapping indices,Change is detectable within the period of the study
4.1,Output ,Community wildlife management plan developed ,Number of wildlife management plans ratefied,Ratefied community wildife management plan,Management methods are adopted at the appropriate scale
4.1.1,Activity,Annual in-situ wildlife monitoring conducted,Statistical evidence of population trend,Camera trapping ,Sample size is sufficiently high to make inferences
4.1.2,Activity,Locals are trained to participate in the camera trapping study,Number of people trained,Training sign-in records,"Access to training is not politicised, women are not excluded"
5,Purpose,Women are able to access maternal health services,Improvements in clinic visitation rates,Clinic records,Community health workers stay engaqged
5.1,Output ,Women make better use of health clinics during pregnancy,Change in clinic visitation rates,Clinic records,All visitations are recorded
5.1.1,Activity,Community awareness of maternal health services,Number of women aware of services,Survey of women,Access to women is not impeded
5.1.2,Activity,Community maternal health workers are trained,Number of people trained,Training sign-in records,"Access to training is not politicised, training is held at times when women can attend"
6,Purpose,Mustelid numbers can be controlled,Relative abundance of mustelids ,Trapping catch,Trapping is sufficent to cause suppression
6.1,Output ,Control plan for mustelids are developed,Number of control plans,Ratefied community control plan,Control plans are adopted
5.1.1,Activity,Trapping thresholds for suppression established,Statistical evidence of suppresion,Study data,Mustelid suppression by trapping is possible
5.1.2,Activity,Trap lines are established,Map of trap locations,Trap locations,Landholders are willing to allow traps on their land
5.1.3,Activity,Locals are trained in the use of kill traps for mustelids,Number of people trained,Training sign-in records,Access to training is not politicised
